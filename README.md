This was a poc development for multi-modal trip planning in India. 
For that, time tables of trains and flights were needed. Paytm website was scraped to get flights time table. Scraping code was written in such a way that proxy rotation happened and the ip does not get banned.
Using that, GTFS format data was created to feed to Opentripplanner - an open source multi modal trip planning software.
